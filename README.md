SEQUOIA is an algorithm which can use the neuronal network DANSur, NRH or NRSur to estimate GW signals parameters and plots the distributions obtained alongside with the results from Zenodo. 
It works for a list of events, which are assumed to be named such as:

```text

GWdate              <- Event directory
├── GWdate_l1.h5   
├── GWdate_h1.h5    <- Event interferometer data
├── GWdate_v1.h5
└── GWdate.h5       <- Zenodo file
```

These events were obtained used the python gwosc package and will not work for the events from GWTC webpage (though the script can easily be modified to make it work). Right now it usses the priors from the zenodo file but this can be configurated at will on the zenodo priors file. The duration, sampling frecuency and route to the directories with data are configurated in the configuration section. SEQUOIA follos an almost identical installation as DANSur, instructrions for this can be found in https://github.com/osvaldogramaxo/DANSur_22/. After that, install nrsur executing gwsurrogate.catalog.pull('NRSur7dq4') and nrh with gwsurrogate.catalog.pull('NRHybSur3dq8'). These 2 lines only need to be run once.


Total pacakages needed: bilby, h5py, matplotlib, numpy os, gwpy, numpy, os plus all those needed to make dansur work (see previos link for reference). More information in the .txt attached. Keep in mind that DANSur has not been trained for low mass events (chirp mass <20 solar masses).
